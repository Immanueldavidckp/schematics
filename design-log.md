## 2026-09-01 — Step 0: Environment setup

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| KiCad | **10.0.0** already installed at `C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0` (KiCad 8.0 also present) |
| easyeda2kicad | 1.0.1 installed via pip (Python 3.10.0) |
| kicad-mcp | Cloned to `~/kicad-mcp`, installed, registered as `kicad` MCP server — health check: **Connected** |

**Deviations from SKILL.md (flagged):**

1. **KiCad 10 instead of KiCad 9.** KiCad 10.0.0 was already installed; it opens/writes v9-format files natively. Using it rather than downgrading. All CLI checks below ran on 10.0.0.
2. **kicad-mcp has no `requirements.txt`** (repo now uses `pyproject.toml`). Followed the skill's fallback instruction ("follow its README"). Installed as a package instead.
3. **kicad-mcp dependency pinning.** Latest `fastmcp` 4.0 / `mcp` 2.x broke `kicad_mcp` imports (`mcp.server.fastmcp` removed in mcp 2.x). Pinned `fastmcp==2.12.5` + `mcp 1.16.0` (a compatible pair) in the **global** Python 3.10 environment. A dedicated venv was attempted first but Windows Application Control blocked freshly-copied `pydantic_core` DLLs inside it, so the venv was removed. Side effect repaired: `starlette` restored to `<0.37` for the pre-existing `fastapi` install.

## 2026-09-01 — Milestone 1: Project + library import + footprint verification

### Project created

- `telematics-tracker.kicad_pro` — JLCPCB-safe board rules pre-seeded (min track/space 0.15 mm, via 0.45/0.3 mm per SKILL.md §PCB rules).
- `telematics-tracker.kicad_pcb` — 4-layer stackup placeholder: F.Cu / In1.Cu (`GND_L2`) / In2.Cu (`PWR_L3`) / B.Cu. No outline yet (layout is milestone 4).
- `telematics-tracker.kicad_sch` — empty root sheet; hierarchical sheets come in milestone 2.
- `sym-lib-table` / `fp-lib-table` — project-local library `jlc` → `${KIPRJMOD}/lib/jlc.kicad_sym` + `lib/jlc.pretty`.
- **Parse check:** `kicad-cli sch erc` → 0 errors/0 warnings. `kicad-cli pcb drc` → 1 error: `invalid_outline` (no Edge.Cuts yet). **Expected pre-layout; accepted until milestone 4.**

### Library import (easyeda2kicad 1.0.1, full: symbol + footprint + 3D)

### Footprint verification

Method: automated S-expression parse of every `.kicad_mod` (pad count, numbering continuity, pad-1 presence + silk marker, pitch, extents, courtyard/silk/fab layers) + symbol pin-count cross-check + datasheet comparison. The EC200U (highest-cost, highest-risk part) was verified pad-class-by-pad-class against the rendered mechanical drawings of Quectel *EC200U Series Hardware Design V1.2* §6.1–6.2. Symbols: pin count = footprint pad count for **all 12 parts**; all pad numbering sequential with no gaps; all footprints have pad 1, courtyard, and silkscreen.

| Footprint | Checks vs datasheet | Status |
|---|---|---|
| LCC-LGA-144 (EC200U) | 144 pads = 80 LCC (0.8×2.5, **1.30 mm pitch** ✓) + 64 LGA (27× 2.0×3.0 + 36× 1.1×1.1 ✓ exact match to Fig. 40) ; body 31×28 ✓; pad 1 top-left + 2 silk markers ✓; land extent 33.6×31.1 vs Quectel recommended 34.3×31.3 (LCC pads ~0.35 mm/side shorter outboard — JLC-proven variant, accepted) | **VERIFIED** (notes V-1, V-2) |
| LQFP-48 (AT32F403ACGT7) | 48 pads, 0.5 pitch, lead-span extent 9.84 (LS 9.0 + toe) ✓ standard LQFP-48 7×7 | VERIFIED |
| LGA-14 (QMI8658B) | 14 pads, 0.5 pitch, extent 3.2×2.7 vs body 3.0×2.5 ✓; pad-1 top-left ("TL") per QST datasheet | VERIFIED |
| SOP-8 (SIT1051AT/3) | 8 pads, 1.27 pitch, span extent 7.23 (LS 6.0 nominal) ✓ standard narrow SOIC-8 | VERIFIED |
| SO-8-EP (LM5164DDAR) | 8 pads 1.27 pitch + EP #9 3.2×2.5 vs TI DDA thermal pad ≈3.05×2.51 (land slightly larger — OK for thermal vias) | VERIFIED (note V-3) |
| VQFN-24-EP (BQ25606RGER) | 24 pads 0.5 pitch + EP #25 2.8×2.8 vs TI RGE EP 2.7 nominal ✓ | VERIFIED |
| ESOP-8 (TP4056) | 8 + EP #9 3.3×2.4 ✓ standard ESOP-8 | VERIFIED (fallback part) |
| LGA-12 (SC7A20TR) | 12 pads, 0.5 pitch, 2×2 body ✓ | VERIFIED (fallback part) |
| SMB (SMBJ100A) | 2 pads, extent 6.77 ✓ DO-214AA land | VERIFIED (note V-4) |
| SOP-4 (EL357N) | 4 pads, 2.54 pitch, span 7.6 (LS 7.0) ✓ | VERIFIED |
| TO-252-5 (XL7015E1) | 5 leads 1.27 pitch + tab 6.21×6.21 ✓ | VERIFIED (fallback part) |
| LQFP-64 (GD32F105RBT6) | Geometrically valid, but part not in BOM | **DO NOT USE** — issue F-1 |

### Issues / flags for the user

- **F-1 (BLOCKER for U7):** SKILL.md's import list contains **C81551, which resolves to GD32F105RBT6** (LQFP-64 MCU) — not in the BOM. Meanwhile **U7 (W25Q64JV SPI NOR flash) has no C-number and no imported footprint** — the handoff itself says "verify: W25Q64JVSSIQ". C81551 is almost certainly a typo for the flash's real C-number (W25Q64JVSSIQ is LCSC **C179171** — unverified, needs confirmation). Per golden rule 2, **no C-number changed**; awaiting user confirmation before importing the flash. The GD32 symbol/footprint stays in the library unused until then.
- **V-1:** EC200U footprint file is named `…L610-CN-02` — it is the EasyEDA/LCSC footprint for the MobileTek L610, a pin-compatible clone of the EC200U form factor. Verified against the *Quectel* drawing regardless (above); geometry matches.
- **V-2:** EC200U footprint contains one **zero-size pad (0.005×0.005 mm)** in the LGA area — an EasyEDA placeholder for a RESERVED pin. Watch for DRC complaints in milestone 4; if it trips, enlarge to the neighboring 1.1 mm square size (same position) or delete — decision deferred, will be logged.
- **V-3:** Verification was automated (parse + datasheet cross-check) rather than the GUI eyeball pass the skill describes. A visual 3D/GUI review in KiCad is still recommended before layout; scheduled with the milestone-5 3D render review.
- **V-4:** SMBJ100A footprint has no meaningful polarity distinction risk at footprint level, but **cathode-vs-pad-1 orientation must be pinned down at schematic capture** (unidirectional TVS: cathode to VIN). Added to milestone-2 checklist.
- **Deferred imports (expected):** "select in stock" BOM lines (U8 level shifter, U9 LDO, Q1–Q3 FETs, X1 SIM holder, J1 Micro-Fit, antennas, all passives) are chosen and imported at schematic time per handoff §3.

### Milestone gate status

- ERC 0/0 ✓ (empty root sheet) · DRC 1 known/accepted (no outline yet)
- Milestone 2 (schematics) **NOT started** — on hold per user instruction pending handoff §9 open items (max sustained VIN, housing model, DO load spec). The §9 VIN answer may change the power front end (LM5164 at 100 V has zero derating margin; XL7015 fallback caps at 80 V).
