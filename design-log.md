## 2026-09-01 — Step 0: Environment setup

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| KiCad | **10.0.0** already installed at `C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0` (KiCad 8.0 also present) |
| easyeda2kicad | 1.0.1 installed via pip (Python 3.10.0) |
| kicad-mcp | Cloned to `~/kicad-mcp`, installed, registered as `kicad` MCP server — health check: **Connected** |

**Deviations from SKILL.md (flagged):**

1. **KiCad 10 instead of KiCad 9.** KiCad 10.0.0 was already installed; it opens/writes v9-format files natively. Using it rather than downgrading. All CLI checks below ran on 10.0.0.
2. **kicad-mcp has no `requirements.txt`** (repo now uses `pyproject.toml`). Followed the skill's fallback instruction ("follow its README"). Installed as a package instead.
3. **kicad-mcp dependency pinning.** Latest `fastmcp` 4.0 / `mcp` 2.x broke `kicad_mcp` imports (`mcp.server.fastmcp` removed in mcp 2.x). Pinned `fastmcp==2.12.5` + `mcp 1.16.0` (a compatible pair) in the **global** Python 3.10 environment. A dedicated venv was attempted first but Windows Application Control blocked freshly-copied `pydantic_core` DLLs inside it, so the venv was removed. Side effect repaired: `starlette` restored to `<0.37` for the pre-existing `fastapi` install.

## 2026-09-01 — Milestone 1: Project + library import + footprint verification

### Project created

- `telematics-tracker.kicad_pro` — JLCPCB-safe board rules pre-seeded (min track/space 0.15 mm, via 0.45/0.3 mm per SKILL.md §PCB rules).
- `telematics-tracker.kicad_pcb` — 4-layer stackup placeholder: F.Cu / In1.Cu (`GND_L2`) / In2.Cu (`PWR_L3`) / B.Cu. No outline yet (layout is milestone 4).
- `telematics-tracker.kicad_sch` — empty root sheet; hierarchical sheets come in milestone 2.
- `sym-lib-table` / `fp-lib-table` — project-local library `jlc` → `${KIPRJMOD}/lib/jlc.kicad_sym` + `lib/jlc.pretty`.
- **Parse check:** `kicad-cli sch erc` → 0 errors/0 warnings. `kicad-cli pcb drc` → 1 error: `invalid_outline` (no Edge.Cuts yet). **Expected pre-layout; accepted until milestone 4.**

### Library import (easyeda2kicad 1.0.1, full: symbol + footprint + 3D)

All 12 C-numbers from SKILL.md imported successfully into `lib/jlc.*`:

| C-number | Symbol imported | Footprint | BOM role |

| C81551 | **GD32F105RBT6** | LQFP-64 10×10 | **⚠ NOT IN BOM — see issue F-1** |

### Footprint verification

Method: automated S-expression parse of every `.kicad_mod` (pad count, numbering continuity, pad-1 presence + silk marker, pitch, extents, courtyard/silk/fab layers) + symbol pin-count cross-check + datasheet comparison. The EC200U (highest-cost, highest-risk part) was verified pad-class-by-pad-class against the rendered mechanical drawings of Quectel *EC200U Series Hardware Design V1.2* §6.1–6.2. Symbols: pin count = footprint pad count for **all 12 parts**; all pad numbering sequential with no gaps; all footprints have pad 1, courtyard, and silkscreen.

| Footprint | Checks vs datasheet | Status |
|---|---|---|
| LCC-LGA-144 (EC200U) | 144 pads = 80 LCC (0.8×2.5, **1.30 mm pitch** ✓) + 64 LGA (27× 2.0×3.0 + 36× 1.1×1.1 ✓ exact match to Fig. 40) ; body 31×28 ✓; pad 1 top-left + 2 silk markers ✓; land extent 33.6×31.1 vs Quectel recommended 34.3×31.3 (LCC pads ~0.35 mm/side shorter outboard — JLC-proven variant, accepted) | **VERIFIED** (notes V-1, V-2) |
| LQFP-48 (AT32F403ACGT7) | 48 pads, 0.5 pitch, lead-span extent 9.84 (LS 9.0 + toe) ✓ standard LQFP-48 7×7 | VERIFIED |
| LGA-14 (QMI8658B) | 14 pads, 0.5 pitch, extent 3.2×2.7 vs body 3.0×2.5 ✓; pad-1 top-left ("TL") per QST datasheet | VERIFIED |
| SOP-8 (SIT1051AT/3) | 8 pads, 1.27 pitch, span extent 7.23 (LS 6.0 nominal) ✓ standard narrow SOIC-8 | VERIFIED |
| SO-8-EP (LM5164DDAR) | 8 pads 1.27 pitch + EP #9 3.2×2.5 vs TI DDA thermal pad ≈3.05×2.51 (land slightly larger — OK for thermal vias) | VERIFIED (note V-3) |
| VQFN-24-EP (BQ25606RGER) | 24 pads 0.5 pitch + EP #25 2.8×2.8 vs TI RGE EP 2.7 nominal ✓ | VERIFIED |
| ESOP-8 (TP4056) | 8 + EP #9 3.3×2.4 ✓ standard ESOP-8 | VERIFIED (fallback part) |
| LGA-12 (SC7A20TR) | 12 pads, 0.5 pitch, 2×2 body ✓ | VERIFIED (fallback part) |
| SMB (SMBJ100A) | 2 pads, extent 6.77 ✓ DO-214AA land | VERIFIED (note V-4) |
| SOP-4 (EL357N) | 4 pads, 2.54 pitch, span 7.6 (LS 7.0) ✓ | VERIFIED |
| TO-252-5 (XL7015E1) | 5 leads 1.27 pitch + tab 6.21×6.21 ✓ | VERIFIED (fallback part) |
| LQFP-64 (GD32F105RBT6) | Geometrically valid, but part not in BOM | **DO NOT USE** — issue F-1 |

### Issues / flags for the user

- **F-1 (BLOCKER for U7):** SKILL.md's import list contains **C81551, which resolves to GD32F105RBT6** (LQFP-64 MCU) — not in the BOM. Meanwhile **U7 (W25Q64JV SPI NOR flash) has no C-number and no imported footprint** — the handoff itself says "verify: W25Q64JVSSIQ". C81551 is almost certainly a typo for the flash's real C-number (W25Q64JVSSIQ is LCSC **C179171** — unverified, needs confirmation). Per golden rule 2, **no C-number changed**; awaiting user confirmation before importing the flash. The GD32 symbol/footprint stays in the library unused until then.
- **V-1:** EC200U footprint file is named `…L610-CN-02` — it is the EasyEDA/LCSC footprint for the MobileTek L610, a pin-compatible clone of the EC200U form factor. Verified against the *Quectel* drawing regardless (above); geometry matches.
- **V-2:** EC200U footprint contains one **zero-size pad (0.005×0.005 mm)** in the LGA area — an EasyEDA placeholder for a RESERVED pin. Watch for DRC complaints in milestone 4; if it trips, enlarge to the neighboring 1.1 mm square size (same position) or delete — decision deferred, will be logged.
- **V-3:** Verification was automated (parse + datasheet cross-check) rather than the GUI eyeball pass the skill describes. A visual 3D/GUI review in KiCad is still recommended before layout; scheduled with the milestone-5 3D render review.
- **V-4:** SMBJ100A footprint has no meaningful polarity distinction risk at footprint level, but **cathode-vs-pad-1 orientation must be pinned down at schematic capture** (unidirectional TVS: cathode to VIN). Added to milestone-2 checklist.
- **Deferred imports (expected):** "select in stock" BOM lines (U8 level shifter, U9 LDO, Q1–Q3 FETs, X1 SIM holder, J1 Micro-Fit, antennas, all passives) are chosen and imported at schematic time per handoff §3.

### Milestone gate status

- ERC 0/0 ✓ (empty root sheet) · DRC 1 known/accepted (no outline yet)
- Milestone 2 (schematics) **NOT started** — on hold per user instruction pending handoff §9 open items (max sustained VIN, housing model, DO load spec). The §9 VIN answer may change the power front end (LM5164 at 100 V has zero derating margin; XL7015 fallback caps at 80 V).

## 2026-09-01 — F-1 resolution: U7 flash import, GD32 removal

User resolved issue F-1: C81551 (GD32F105RBT6) was a leftover fallback MCU, not a flash typo. Actions taken on user instruction:

### Removals

- **C81551 / GD32F105RBT6 removed** from the `SKILL.md` import loop (replaced with C2685734) and purged from the library: symbol block deleted from `jlc.kicad_sym` (14,459 chars, balanced S-expression removal, zero residual references), `LQFP-64_L10.0-W10.0-P0.50-LS12.0-BL.kicad_mod` deleted, both LQFP-64 3D models (.wrl/.step) deleted. Library re-validated with `kicad-cli sym upgrade` on a scratch copy — parses clean.

### U7 flash: GD25Q64ESIG (LCSC C2685734) imported as primary

- Symbol + footprint `SOP-8_L5.3-W5.3-P1.27-LS8.0-BL` + 3D models imported via easyeda2kicad. Stock at import decision: 20,951 pcs (user-verified).
- **Alternates recorded** (user-verified pin- and command-compatible): **W25Q64JVSSIQ — LCSC C179171 / C2904572**, same SOIC-8 208mil footprint. Stored in the symbol's `Alternate` property and here.

### Footprint verification vs GD25Q64E datasheet rev 1.5 §10.2 (SOP8 208MIL)

| Check | Datasheet | Footprint | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lead span E | 7.70–8.10 (nom 7.90) | outer extent 9.28 = nom span + IPC toe | ✓ |
| Body width E1 | 5.18–5.38 | inner pad gap 4.87 (heel under lead, L=0.50–0.85) | ✓ |
| Pitch e | 1.27 | 1.27 | ✓ |
| Lead width b | 0.31–0.51 (nom 0.41) | pad width 0.609 | ✓ |
| Pads/numbering | 8, no gaps, pad 1 + silk marker, courtyard | — | ✓ |
| Pinout | 1 CS#, 2 SO(IO1), 3 WP#(IO2), 4 VSS, 5 SI(IO0), 6 SCLK, 7 HOLD#(IO3), 8 VCC | symbol matches; identical to W25Q64JV; matches handoff §5 U7 wiring (WP#/HOLD# to 3V3) | ✓ |
| Speed/size | 133 MHz, 8 MB | handoff needs ≥30 MHz SPI, 8 MB ≈ 6 days buffer | ✓ |

**VERIFIED** — U7 footprint and symbol released for schematic capture.

### New flag for the user

- **F-2 (temperature grade):** C2685734 = GD25Q64E**SI**G = industrial **I-grade, −40…+85 °C**. The datasheet ordering table lists a J-grade (−40…**+105 °C**) variant of the same package: **GD25Q64ESJG**. Handoff rule 6 requires ≥105 °C semiconductors *where available*. Options: (a) keep ESIG (85 °C) and justify — flash is low-self-heating and inside the enclosure thermal budget; (b) switch to ESJG if stocked at JLCPCB. **Awaiting user decision; no change made.**

### Status

- Milestone 2 remains **on hold** pending handoff §9 answers (unchanged).

## 2026-09-01 — F-2 resolution: U7 temperature grade — **KEEP C2685734** (85 °C, justified)

### Q1: Is GD25Q64ESJG (J-grade, 105 °C, SOP-8 208mil) stocked?

**No.** LCSC/JLCPCB carry **6** GD25Q64E variants; **all are I-grade (−40…+85 °C)**. GD25Q64ESJG is not in the catalog at any price.

| MPN | LCSC | Package | Grade | Stock | @1k |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GD25Q64ESIG | **C2685734** (ours) | SOP-8-208mil | I, 85 °C | 19,986 | $0.5036 |
| GD25Q64ESIGR | C2831359 | SOP-8-208mil | I, 85 °C | 16,745 | $0.4920 |
| GD25Q64ETIGR | C2976334 | SOP-8 **150mil** | I, 85 °C | 1,420 | $0.7789 |
| GD25Q64EYIGR / EQIGR / EWIGR | — | WSON/USON | I, 85 °C | **0** | — |

### Q2: What is GD25Q64ETIGR (C2976334)? — **incompatible, ruled out**

Datasheet §9 ordering table decode of the `T`: **SOP8 150mil**, not 208mil. LCSC's generic "SOIC-8" label hides this. Dimensions from §10.1 vs our footprint (§10.2, 208mil):

| Symbol | 150mil (C2976334) | 208mil (ours) |
|---|---|---|
| Lead span E | 6.00 nom | 7.90 nom |
| Body width E1 | 3.90 nom | 5.28 nom |
| Body length D | 4.90 nom | 5.23 nom |

**~1.9 mm narrower lead span — will not solder to our land pattern.** Also I-grade anyway, 14× less stock, 55 % more expensive. Rejected on package grounds before temperature is even considered.

### Q3: Does *any* 105 °C part fit our footprint? — **No** (cross-vendor sweep)

Swept all three major NOR vendors — **110 part numbers** — for a 3.3 V, SOP/SOIC-8-208mil, 105 °C SPI NOR:

| Family | Results | 208mil + 3.3 V + 105 °C in stock |
|---|---|---|
| GigaDevice GD25Q64E | 6 | none (all 85 °C) |
| Winbond W25Q64J | 42 | none (all 208mil parts 85 °C, incl. `…SSIM` C5362615) |
| Macronix MX25L64 | 62 | none (all SOP-8/SOIC-8-208mil 85 °C) |

Only 105 °C 64 Mbit part found anywhere: **W25Q64JWBYIQ (C2691929)** — WLCSP-12 **and** 1.7–1.95 V. Doubly incompatible (wrong package, wrong rail; our flash sits on 3V3).

### Decision — per user's decision rule, branch 2 ("if not stocked")

**U7 stays GD25Q64ESIG / C2685734.** No C-number changed. Winbond alternate is **not** re-flagged as derated: it is the *same* −40…+85 °C I-grade as the primary, so it remains an equal-grade alternate (grade now recorded explicitly in the symbol's `Alternate` field to prevent future ambiguity).

**Logged justification for the 85 °C deviation from handoff rule 6 (≥105 °C where available) — rule 6's "where available" condition is not met:**

1. **Junction ≈ ambient.** The flash is a near-zero-dissipation load: 12 µA standby, and active writes are ~4 mA in short bursts at 150 B/10 s (handoff §6). Self-heating is negligible, so T_J tracks in-enclosure ambient with no thermal-rise margin consumed — unlike the LM5164 or the modem, which are the real thermal actors on this board.
2. **Firmware write-throttling above 80 °C.** MCU reads its internal temperature sensor; above 80 °C the ring-buffer flush rate is throttled and non-critical writes are deferred, cutting program/erase cycling in the hot tail of the distribution (P/E endurance and retention degrade fastest at high temperature — this protects the 100k-cycle and 20-year-retention budget, not just the die).
3. **Shaded-mount installation note.** Installation instructions specify mounting the enclosure out of direct sun / off hot machine surfaces, keeping in-enclosure ambient inside the 85 °C rating for Indian summer field conditions.

**Carry-forward actions this creates for later milestones:**
- Firmware spec (post-layout): implement the 80 °C write-throttle above; requires MCU internal temp sensor channel — already available on the AT32 ADC, no hardware change.
- Documentation (milestone 6): add the shaded-mount requirement to the installation sheet.
- Re-check at order day: if a 105 °C 208mil part has appeared in stock, revisit before committing to volume.

### New flag for the user

- **F-3 (packaging, low priority):** our C2685734 is **tube-packed**; the otherwise identical **C2831359 (GD25Q64ESIGR)** is **tape & reel**, 16,745 in stock, and marginally cheaper ($0.492 vs $0.5036 @1k). Same die, package, and grade. T&R is the preferred feeder format for JLCPCB SMT assembly. Per golden rule 2, **no change made** — flagging for your approval; worth switching at order time if JLCPCB prefers reel for this line item.

### Housekeeping completed

- `SKILL.md` **moved** from `C:\home\PCB\Telematics\SKILL.md` into the repo at **`docs/SKILL.md`** (now version-controlled; it previously sat outside the repo root and its C-number fix was untracked).
- Synced to `~/.claude/skills/kicad-telematics/SKILL.md` — SHA-256 verified identical to `docs/SKILL.md`. Skill confirmed loaded/registered by Claude Code after sync.
- `telematics-handoff.md` deliberately left at `C:\home\PCB\Telematics\` (user's document, not a repo artifact).
- **Re-sync reminder:** `docs/SKILL.md` is now canonical. Any future edit must be copied back to `~/.claude/skills/kicad-telematics/SKILL.md` or the two will drift.

### Status

- Milestone 2 remains **on hold** pending handoff §9 answers (max sustained VIN, housing model, DO load spec). F-1 and F-2 are both closed; **no open blockers on the library side** — all U1–U7 footprints verified and released for schematic capture.

*Next entry: milestone 2 kickoff after §9 answers.*
